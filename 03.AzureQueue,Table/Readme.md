The repository contains a Sample Wpf Application which can be used to perform enqueue or dequeue opeartions on a queue named "QuickStart" and crud operations on a table named "Student". 
The only configuration change required is to set connnection string of QuickStartStorage.
    
The repository also contains two html pages and javascript libraries provided by Microsoft. 
This would be the quickest way to look into your queue and tables.
